Hi! This is the full source code for my website. I wanted my own little corner of the internet, and I think it turned out pretty well. Take a look around and lemme know what you think.

## Colophon

For fonts, I use [Atkinson Hyperlegible Next](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible) and [Berkeley Mono](https://usgraphics.com/products/berkeley-mono). Icons are provided by [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). It is currently deployed on Vercel.

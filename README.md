# my personal site

hi! this is the code for my website. it was built using [Astro](https://astro.build), Tailwind, some React, and deployed on Vercel.

design and primary colors were planned out in Figma. primary font is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible), and monospace font is [Maple Mono](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font). icons provided by Lucide.

I wanted my own little corner of the internet, and I think it turned out pretty well. take a look around and lemme know what you think.

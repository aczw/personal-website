Hi! This is the code for my website. I wanted my own little corner of the internet, and I think it turned out pretty well. Take a look around and lemme know what you think.

## Colophon

Fonts are [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible) and [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/). Icons are from Lucide. If you're curious, I [keep a changelog](https://charleszw.com/changelog) of notable updates I've made to the site.

It is built with Astro and is currently deployed on Vercel.

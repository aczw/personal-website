welcome to my personal website. it was made using the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/), namely Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

some items of interest, maybe:

- `/ttt`: tic-tac-toe

I wanted to have my own little corner on the internet, and along the way learned some web dev as well. take a look around and lemme know what you think.

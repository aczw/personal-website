hi! this is the code for my website. it was built with Astro, styled with Tailwind, and deployed on Vercel.

design and colors were prototyped in Figma and Procreate. fonts used are [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible) and [Maple Mono](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font). icons are provided by [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). if you're curious, I [wrote a post](https://charl.sh/projects/www) about how I made the site and the changes it's been through.

I wanted my own little corner of the internet, and I think it turned out pretty well. take a look around and lemme know what you think.

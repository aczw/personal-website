# my personal site

hi! this is the code for my website, accessible at [charl.sh](https://charl.sh). it was made using [Astro](https://astro.build), Tailwind, the tiniest bit of React, and deployed on Vercel.

design and primary colors were planned out in Figma. primary font is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible), and monospace font is [Maple Mono](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font). Icons provided by [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/), Material, and Lucide.

I wanted my own little corner of the internet, and I think it turned out pretty well. take a look around and lemme know what you think.

hi! this is the code for my website. it was built using Astro, Tailwind, React, and deployed on Vercel.

design and primary colors were planned out in Figma. main font used is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible), and monospace font is [Maple Mono](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font). icons provided by Lucide.

I wanted my own little corner of the internet, and I think it turned out pretty well. take a look around and lemme know what you think.

Hi! This is the code for my website. I wanted my own little corner of the internet, and I think it turned out pretty well. Take a look around and lemme know what you think.

## Colophon

I use [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_Hyperlegible) and [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/). Icons are from Lucide. The website is 100% Astro and does not use any external UI libraries. Currently deployed on Vercel's free plan.

title: Why I've stopped jailbreaking my iPhone
blurb: I have jailbroken some Apple device of mine, in one way or another, for a good part of the past decade. And although it will always be near and dear to my heart, I've decided to move on.

## Early days

- Jailbreaking my family's iPad gen 1 and paying the consequences
- unlocking the bootloader of my first ever Android phone (OPO), remember failing multiple times at my friend's house (my dad used to control the family computer and didn't let me have the admin password, so i couldn't install the stuff i needed at home)
  - installing LineageOS
  - installing all kinds of crazy customizations
- High school APEX project was abt jailbreaking (find PPTX file?), even argued that jailbreaking is a gray area and encouraged people to do it. my Peak nerd days.

## Glory days

- iPhone 6s, all the jailbreaks
- dig up screenshots of my saved tweaks
- paid for many tweaks! paid my dues.
- even tried installing Project Sandcastle, but couldn't figure it out in the end. pull up github issue that i left, if possible?

## Comeback

- stopped for a while after switching to 13
- got used to old life
- eventually did Bootstrap and Serotonin
- got most of my setup back (show it off!)

## Waning days

- most features apple have incorporated into main iOS
  - new customizable control center in iOS 18
- stuff i will miss
  - no labels on apps without increasing their size
  - truly custom app icons and badge colors
  - truly customizable system font, lockscreen font
    - with caveat that they don't want iOS to look fugly, which I understand, stereotype of the shitty Android app skins
  - being able to install any app beyond the app store with the dirtycow thing, unrestricted by signing issues
- reasons for leaving
  - app jailbreak detection
  - starting to get actual finances, banking apps
  - stuck on low iOS version
    - related, but can't update watchOS either. i know there are tweaks to bypass this, but they cost money and require more investment to learn the intricacies of, instead of just.... not dealing with this. this has caused some funky stuff like me being semi-logged in and apple constantly asking me to sign in on my watch.
  - also, new jailbreaks releasing at a slower pace
  - random restarts
  - don't really have time to keep up with new developments, less time to tinker, didn't really take advantage of anything - why keep maintaining that and risk a less secure/stable device?
  - new products didn't work 100% - i got airpods pro 2 recently, they show up weirdly. can only check basic battery information, but even that's a bit scuffed.

## conclusion

i will miss the days, jailbreaking was a very large part of my childhood and taught me to always tinker and explore the products that i use and to push them to their full potential

that “tinker” ethos will always stick with me and is still presenting itself in other ways, e.g. Plex server or triple booting operating systems or setting up a custom desktop environment on my Arch install.

note i'm not claiming that jailbreaking is dying. i don't believe jailbreaking will ever die. there will always exist a community, there will always exist people who live for this shit, and i've always been a bystander and enjoyed the fruits of their labor.

i'm a Broke College Student TM right now, but hell, in the future i would love to buy an old Android or iPhone and throw checkra1n or lineageOS on it and play with it.

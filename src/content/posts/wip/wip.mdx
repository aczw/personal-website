Welcome to my little corner on the internet.

When I first started learning web dev, this site was my first project. One of the things I immediately added was a blog: somewhere I can write about what I'm doing and the things I like. Naturally, the first entry was about this site and the experience of building it.

For the longest time, I treated this post as a "source of truth" for how my website _finally_ came to be. A sort of explanation post for the _final_ state of the site. Clearly, it wasn't going to change anymore this time!

I was horribly wrong. At this point, this site has undergone four _major_ refactorings. The first three times, this post has also been rewritten. After all, the site has changed in a significant way, and I needed to mention how. Otherwise, the post would be outdated, right?

I realize now this was the wrong way to go about things, and I think it's largely a mindset problem: even though the site is largely tied to who I am as a person, I somehow thought that it would remain in a standstill. Even when I (invevitably) change and grow.

**Just like us, websites are never a finished product. Especially personal ones. And not just websites, but any projects that you care deeply for.**

I experienced this phenomenon firsthand over the past year. This is my fourth rewrite of "my website post". At this point, the post isn't about _building websites_ or _tracking changes_ anymore. The new post title reflects that.

> A changelog fits the purpose of tracking changes a lot better; whenever I have new stuff to yap about, I add a new patch note. I talk a bit more about that idea in [its own post](/posts/changelogs).

Things change, and I should _expect_ things to change. This applies to everything, not just some random person's identity crisis for their website (hint: me). The fact that this post itself has now gone under multiple rewrites is a very beautiful and symbolic thing. I can't tell you what it means, but it definitely feels right.

## But why?

I've written a lot of words about what has changed. Another equally important question is why I keep changing things. I mean, I know everyone does it, once you catch redesign-my-website-itis, it infects you forever.

But I would like to explain my own reasoning.

With each successive version, my expectations, preferences, and goals for this website change. One central motivation has remained the same though, which is the desire to _express myself_. Unfortunately, I have had many ideas about how to go about it.

This platform we're on feels infinite. It's easy to think of the Internetâ„¢ as just Google, Twitter, and YouTube, but I've gravitated towards the web so much because you have limitless control over how to present yourself. HTML, CSS, and JS are very, very powerful and accessible.

I'm often torn between making my site look how I want it, and optimizing it for recruiters and employers. I know, be true to yourself or whatever, but I also have hella anxiety. _(My contact info is at the end of this post, by the way.)_

So what's the solution? I have tried out four different approaches now, and as my beliefs change I'm sure I'll think of even more. Every approach has felt like the _correct_ solution at the time. I'm sure they _were_ the correct solution at the time.

Trust your past self a bit more. Seeing v1, v2, v3, etc. as mistakes is the wrong conclusion here.

## Progression, not repetition

In a past version of this post, I titled a section "The cycle continues." It was about how this post has been rewritten over and over again, and, to quote my exact words:

> _"Every new version meant I had to update past sections, and then add a new section explaining why everything before sucked. This went on for quite a while. But I'm kinda tired of it now! No more!_
>
> _The revisions my site has gone through reflect how I've changed as a person, and will continue to change. I will start letting that speak for itself."_

I mostly agree, past me. This ends now, today. But the section heading irked me: there was no cycle going on here. It implies everything repeats again. However, here it's the literal opposite: everything has been changing and evolving.

I get it, though. Every redesign has me starting from scratch all over again. But the process and final result is _always different_. Also, I enjoy doing it. After all, I'm updating something I care about to better reflect the current me!

> It sorta feels like Sisyphus except without the endless, excruciating torture.

Anyway. For real this time, I'll let the changes speak for themselves. Well, that, and also through the [changelog](/changelog). Thanks for reading.

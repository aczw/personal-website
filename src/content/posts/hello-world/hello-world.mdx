Hello, welcome to my little corner on the internet.

I've always wanted my very own website. It felt like a very cool thing to do. It also seemed like a very hard thing to accomplish. Owning one seemed like a very professional, official way of declaring your existence. Like, yes, I am the Charles Wang, so important that you can visit me at `charleszw.com`. Yes!

When I first started learning web dev, I immediately learned three things:

1. Making a website is not that hard.
2. I am not that important.
3. Regardless, I wanted my own website.

I also knew that I wanted some sort of blogging system, where I can publish stuff about my projects and things I've learned. So, here we are.

## Always bet on the web

It's a bit hard at times to remember when all we do is visit Google, Twitter, and YouTube everyday, but literally anyone can come in and start their own website. Custom domains are hella cheap nowadays as well. I'm paying less than a dollar per month for mine.

HTML, CSS, and JS aren't the hardest things to learn. There are so many resources online that the problem now becomes filtering the noise _out_. The web is famously resilient; everyone knows about the [1996 Space Jam website](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.html), but I recently learned about things like [SmooshGate](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/smooshgate/) and [`String.prototype.contains`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=789036), which has only strengthened my resolve.

The first "website" I ever made—a single local HTML file I wrote in my freshman year of high school—still just _works_. There are very few things I can revisit more than half a decade later and still have it function. And with stuff like WebGL and more recently WebGPU coming out, more and more cool stuff is being built.

I just think everyone should learn a little web dev. It's good for the soul. Anyway, /rant over. Thanks for visiting and reading. Please take a look around and lemme know what you think.

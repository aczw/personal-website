This year I'm co-leading [UPGRADE](https://pennupgrade.com), which is UPenn's game dev club. We make two club-wide games, with all members involved, one in every semester. We also host Unity workshops, organize two school-wide game jams, and try to spend as much of our club funding as possible, including on trips to GDC, social events, and general food and drink.

## A little background: PennBoy

But enough self plug! I wanted to write a little about a pattern I've recently discovered while working on UPGRADE's fall semester game, which we're calling PennBoy. The premise is this: we've split our members into groups of 3-4 people. They are all developing minigames for the new and upcoming video game console, PennBoy. Everyone wants a full fledged game on release day!

Essentially, PennBoy is a minigame collection comprised of small games created by students over the course of a semester, spending roughly ~3 hours/week on development time. So we're not expecting anything big or revolutionary; quite the opposite, this is our opportunity to teach those new to Unity how the engine works, and their opportunity to get familiar with Unity's behavior and the game dev workflow in general.

## Main UI

While our members work on their respective minigames, I've been dealing with everything else, including the main menu and overarching UI. There's a lot of exciting stuff I still want to explore hereâ€”we're mimicking the Nintendo Wii's channel system, but there are so many ways we can make it look and feel unique.

### Programatically animating things

As part of any good UI, we want it to feel fluid and nicely animate and transiton between screens. Now, I could do this with Unity's Animation system, manually setting keypoints and adjusting properties as I want. But there's some reasons I haven't reached for it yet:

- First and foremost, I enjoy programming the most. Unity's editor tools are great, but I feel more at home writing code.
- For me, coding the animations allows me to more quickly prototype ideas and iterate on things.

So a lot of the code for the UI is manipulating `RectTransform`s and `CanvasGroup`s, but I don't mind. Furthermore, which is the point of this post, I've developed a neat way of reusing functionality when it comes to animating.

### Intro sequence

PennBoy begins with the a familiar screen if you grew up playing the Wii: the Health & Safety screen. Besides being a fun easter egg, it also serves as our game's "press any key to continue" screen, because past this you're immediately launched into the game.

[some sort of video?]

Even this ~2 second screen has a lot of things going on: text sliding and fading in, backgrounds zooming in and out, and all of this needs to be programmed.

One of the very first things you learn about Unity is its `Update()` function, which runs all of its contents once every frame. However, we want our animations to occur _across_ frames, which means that we need to somehow keep track of the "progress" of our animation.

Something like this:

```csharp
class Example : MonoBehaviour {
  private float t;

  private void Awake() {
    t = 0f;
  }

  private void Update() {

  }
}
```

This can work technically, but we're not really using `Update()` correctly. For example, we still have to consider the following questions:

- `Update()` will continue to be called. What happens when our animation ends?
- If we wanted to play it again, what would be the best way to trigger that?
- `t` is a nice start, but what if we wanted to slow the animation down? Or we wanted to interpolate between frames in a non-linear fashion?

## Coroutines my beloved

A much better way of dealing with animations is to use coroutines. I'm not going to sit here and pretend I can explain them well, so I'm instead going to link to this [Game Dev Beginner article](https://gamedevbeginner.com/coroutines-in-unity-when-and-how-to-use-them/) that really helped me understand them when I first started learning about it.

Long story short, we can `StartCoroutine()` somewhere in the script's `Awake()` function, and have our animation start playing that way. When we want to play the animation again, we start the coroutine again (while making sure to check that another instance of it isn't currently playing)!

[more context... too lazy to write]

Eventually I realized all of these shared similar properties:

- They divided `t` to make sure it stays between `0` and `1`, which is then used to compute some custom interpolated value.
- They utilized the `elapsedTime` and `while` loop structure, incrementing the elapsed time by the delta time.
- The while loop runs for a specified amount of time, which is essentially the animation time.

### Design pattern

Realizing all of this, I decided to refactor all of these into a single utility function. Here is the end result:

```csharp
// TODO
public static IEnumerator Animate() {
  yield return null;
}
```

Let's break it down:

## Prior art

While checking online to make sure I haven't reinvented the wheel or anything, I discovered that, in fact, I have. [This article by Michael Bitzos](https://michaelbitzos.com/devblog/programmatic-animation-using-coroutines) describes the exact same pattern, all the way down to passing a lambda function accepting the time as its parameter.

This discovery made me insanely happy. I would still consider myself a beginner to Unity, and if I was able to recreate something that someone else has done, by myself, then it must mean I'm doing something right.

The goal of this post was just to share something small that I found cool. Feedback is much appreciated. Thanks for reading.

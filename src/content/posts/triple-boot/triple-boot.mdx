I've done this before, but after having issues with macOS and my trackpad not working, I decided to move on.

Since then I've gotten another taste of macOS at my internship with TikTok, and realized that I really missed it. I've found new value in triple booting:

- there are some cool apps I'm missing out on.
- obviously, Apple ecosystem integration.

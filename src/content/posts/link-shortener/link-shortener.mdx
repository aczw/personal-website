title: Making my own link shortener with Astro DB
blurb: To easily share my Spotify, I like to use link shortener services. I got tired of how they always stopped working, so like any other sane person, I wrote my own.

To see it in action, visit my Spotify profile at [go.czw.sh/spotify](https://go.czw.sh/spotify).

## Background

I like sharing music. To follow my friends and ~~stalk~~ see what they're listening to, I often send them my Spotify profile. However, ever since they removed [custom usernames](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Accounts/Spotify-Username-Completely-Random/td-p/4392395#), I've been stuck with the very memorable username of `zhwq0rxdn060sgar22e07u193`, and searching for my display name is pretty much impossible.

To get around that, I use link shorteners, but I've found that they're very unreliable, and often shut down/stop working. With the recent release of Astro Studio and [Astro DB](https://astro.build/db/), I thought this was the perfect chance to test it out... and solve my issue once and for all.

> I'm also not insane, by the way; a simple search for ["spotify link shortener"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spotify+link+shortener) returns a number of _dedicated websites_ for doing this. Notably, Dub.co has their own [Spotify tool](https://dub.co/tools/spotify-link-shortener), which I used up to this point.

blurb: Reading the update notes for your favorite game or app is always exciting. What's changed? What's not? Maybe websites should do it too.

I like [United States Graphics Company's](https://berkeleygraphics.com/engineering/) (formerly Berkeley Graphics, maker of the monospace font you see on this website) inclusion of a version number in the header, it aligns with their no-bullshit, industrial grade engineering aesthetics. I was also heavily inspired by [moya.cafe's inclusion of a changelog](https://moya.cafe/). The website already has so much personality, and it complements it nicely.

Two wildly different sources of inspiration, but hey. Both are good.

I now have two methods of writing on this site: via posts, or via the changelog. I think both are necessary and fill different gaps: posts are for more permanent things, where edits are mostly for style, not content changes. The changelog is for more temporary things that can quickly become "out of date" and in fact, expects it. Every new update is _supposed_ to void the previous one, by design.

You know how I realized this was the right decision? As part of launching `/changelog` I was rewriting a post about this website _because it was redundant now_. Furthermore, I was able to lift a lot of its content and directly plop it into one of the patch notes, further proving it's always been in the wrong place.

And yes, I'm committed to the bit. I wrote over 10+ release notes and backfilled all previous releases, assigning version numbers to things that didn't have any.

I'm thinking of it as public journaling. For whoever is brave enough to learn from me, they'll be able to see past mistakes I've made and where exactly stuff was introduced.

Anyway, that post has essentially been [completely replaced](/posts/wip). For the better!

Other ways that you can think of this changelog idea:

- A timeline of how my website has changed
- A time machine to see how things have evolved
- A way for me to yap about interesting things I learned while making this site

Whenever I updated this site, I've always kept track of an internal version number in my head. This number showed up as version updates in my package.json, and sometimes I would also name commits after these versions (for example, here's [v4.4.0](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website/commit/d830237fb29a615b9789640f4db8eab8b5614b36), which is actually v3.4.0. Long story). To anyone else, these numbers would look clinically insane, as I've never explained them; but they were there to allow me to keep track of things. It also made it feel like I was working on an actual app that required updates, which felt nice.

Once again, Astro made everything really easy to do. I was largely able to reuse the preexisting code I had for my posts, because each of these changelogs is a MDX file.

You know how weird it was to write in present tense about everything that I did in the past? Yeah anyways.

## Semantic versioning

What does semver mean in the context of my site? There aren't "breaking API changes" when I increment the major number. I followed this standard when assigning versions to past commits:

1. shit
2. fuck

Am I actually going to update the version number for every single little change I made? Of course not. I'm not trying to meticulously track every detail I change; that's not the purpose here.

### Rewriting history

Actually sitting down and assigning version numbers proved to be harder than I thought. For the longest time I've been casually assigning numbers to new releases and nonchalantly incrementing the version count when I felt like it. Now I'm facing the consequences.

For example, what I've always referred to as v1 shouldn't actually be the first stable version, because I never finished it. I restarted in the middle, so nothing was finalized. It had the v1 title simply because v2 was completely different.

But this is not how semver works. If it's not stable, then it's not stable. And if that's true, then it does not deserve a major version change... it should still be in v0.x.0 territory.

So yeah, I shifted everything back. It's now referred to as [v0.4.0](/changelog#v040/v040) and what used to be v2 is now the definite [v1.0.0 release](/changelog#v100/v100). What was originally the v5 release has now become the v4 release.

This was originally going to be v4.5.0. Then, it changed to v5.0.0. Now it's v4.0.0, smaller than the original version number.

I think I'm the first person in history to release a new version with a _smaller_ version number than the previous release. No one else could be this stupid.

## Updating package.json with the current version

It's not like I will ever publish the codebase as a NPM package, but the benefit to this is that I have a single source of truth for the current version of the site.

This comes in handy when I want to reference it in my footer, for example. I first saw this in [Quartz's own `<Footer />` component](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/244801af65b9e628927c1f1b2518ae62ca2e354f/quartz/components/Footer.tsx#L3), where you can literally import the `version` field from `package.json` and reference it like a regular string:

```astro
---
import { version } from "../../package.json";
---

<a href="/changelog">v{version}</a>
```

Earlier I said that I was casually updating the version number whenever I felt like it. This is where I was doing it. So, I actually had to _downgrade_ the package.json version to correct my mistakes. Thank god this package is not public.

## Sticky sidebar

The trickiest part was getting the version, date, and commit hash to be sticky. Adding `align-items: flex-start` solved the issue. This [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66416972) explains it pretty well: the reason is that

Lo and behold, it is also the solution that the Linear changelog uses. Below, notice how "May 30, 2024" becomes sticky as soon as we align items using `flex-start`.

## Something more?

With every update patch to the website, I too have stuff to share, about my life. The website changes and so do I. If I feel brave enough in the future, it might eventually become a [/now](https://nownownow.com/about)-like situation. I can see this happening very naturally, it's an evolution that makes sense to me.

A changelog for the website, a changelog for myself. For everyone to see. Oh boy. Like I said, still thinking about it. But I really do like yapping, so it's very much possible.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Lemme know what you think of the website.

I wanted to write a little about the sixth redesign of my website, v6. I've tried doing this before—writing about changes to my site—but it became [horribly overscoped](https://github.com/aczw/changelog) and I burned out before I could finish.[^1] I was pretty sad about that, so to make sure this sees the light of day I'll stick to a simple post.

## Influence

It's embarrassing but I'm always thinking about how I want to update my website design. As a result I've collected a number of inspirations since v5 which I've put together in this Are.na channel.[^2]

A lot of these blocks emphasize text, structure, and veiled complexity—stuff that looks simple, but hopefully makes you think _hmmm_, but how did they actually do that? I've learned that the simplest stuff often requires the most planning.

### Grids

I've experimented with grid layouts since the beginning of this site. Here's what v1 of the home page looked like at one point:

<figure>
  <div class="rounded-lg border-(length:--border-w) border-dashed border-line-bright">
    ![Screenshot of the first version of this website. Multiple squares of
    different sizes are arranged in a grid in the center.](v1-wip.png)
  </div>
  <figcaption>
    **v1 (WIP).** Fun fact, the Last.fm stats you see are live and still work.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Something about its conformity, rigidity, and formality makes sense to me and is very pleasing. And it has its benefits. Multiple times in development I've faced a design issue and instead of creating some bespoke solution, I've realized that I can just use the grid.

Just follow the grid. Follow The Grid.

## Configuration

A cool thing about Tailwind 4 is that everything is just a CSS variable. From early on I defined the grid spacing and border width using them, via <span class="whitespace-nowrap">`--spacing-pad`</span> and <span class="whitespace-nowrap">`--border-w`</span> respectively, so now I can just update one variable and see changes reflected through the whole site.

Here's a little gadget that lets you do just that.

<SpacingBorderWidthGadget />

With bigger values everything breaks, but the hope is that everything breaks _consistently_ because I used the CSS variable.

## Zooming

To counteract the smaller content width, I wanted some way for people to enlarge an image without having to open it in a new tab. I've also been meaning to play with the HTML [`<dialog>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/dialog) element, so I wrote my own Lightbox-like image magnifier.

It uses very little JS—[a little less than 40 lines](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website/blob/e6c1fd1c95efb776d161afc8f10e13f793983acd/src/components/content-with-toc.astro#L46-L83)—to add event listeners to images and for setting/resetting the image viewer. A bulk of the work is handled by the `<dialog>` element itself, including the overlay and keyboard accessibility.

Try it now with the image below. (Note: not available on mobile because you can just, you know, _zoom in_.)

<figure>

  game.](catanks-deck.jpg)
  <figcaption>
    __Click the image to zoom in.__ Also, what's this? A picture of our recently
    released game, Catanks, [free now on
    Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3793790/Catanks), running on a
    Deck? Oh my!

Nowadays, I rely a lot on HTML data attributes. For instance, I wanted to make certain images non-zoomable. To do this, I add the `data-no-zoom` attribute to them, sort of like a label. The query selector then selects all images such that `img:not([data-no-zoom])`, and only adds event listeners to those.

```html
<!-- Will be zoomable -->
<img src="wow.png" />
<!-- Cannot be zoomed! -->
<img src="epic.jpg" data-no-zoom="" />

<script>
  const zoomable = document.querySelectorAll("img:not([data-no-zoom])");

  zoomable.forEach((elt) => {
    elt.addEventListener("click", () => {
      /* Steal the image URL */
    });
  });
</script>
```

I hope visitors to the site will know it exists! I do change the cursor to a little magnifying glass, and I feel like it's a semi-common pattern across sites, but who knows. I'm chronically online so I've picked up on all the common Patterns.

[^1]: One day I'll revisit it and incorporate it in some other way because I do find merit in having a changelog and seeing all your updates laid out like that.

[^2]: I'm still experimenting with Are.na. I understand why they charge $70/year for Premium, I just don't know if I'm ready for that yet.

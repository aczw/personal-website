Early on in my Linux journey, I was really into customizing my setup and theming _everything_. Form over function, you could say. This is commonly referred to as [ricing](https://jie-fang.github.io/blog/basics-of-ricing) and there are whole [dedicated communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) around it.

There came a time when I wanted to decorate my login screen. Having chosen [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/) as my display manager of choice, I started looking for login themes... and didn't find anything that appealed to me. Thus `sddm-theme-corners` was born.

In the spirit of open source, I made it publicly available on my GitHub. Since then, it's gotten quite a few stars and forks, which makes me happy because people are enjoying something I made :\)

## Designing a login theme

The themes I saw on the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/s/KDE%20Store/browse?cat=101&ord=rating) felt too corporate to me, if that makes sense. They heavily utilize [Gaussian blur](https://store.kde.org/s/KDE%20Store/p/1214121), [thin icons and fonts](https://store.kde.org/s/KDE%20Store/p/1283380"), and others tried doing [too much at once](https://github.com/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-light/wiki/Before-you-begin) for me. It feels like they belong to a past era (granted, some of them are years old now).

This sounds like a diss. None of this is intended to be a diss. They're popular for a reason. Subjectively, the design just didn't appeal to me. Plus, without these projects I would've had no idea where to start programming! (More on this later.)

After some tinkering and iterating, the final result looks like this:

<ImageGallery
  location="write-ups"
  innerPath="sddm-theme-corners/"
  imgs={[
    {
      src: "hanako.png",
      alt: "An orange color scheme featuring completely round corners and Hanako-kun.",
    },
    {
      src: "loud.png",
      alt: "A very colorful background with black and white UI elements and squared corners.",
    },
    {
      src: "sky.png",
      alt: "Sunset over some buildings. UI elements are colored pink and purple.",
    },
  ]}
/>

True to its name, everything is anchored to a corner. Interactive elements live on the bottom half, and the date/time on the top. I chose to group the power and session controls together (versus placing sessions below the user, for instance) because they're less commonly used.

  vids={[{ src: "/projects/sddm-theme-corners/power-session-buttons.mp4", type: "video/mp4" }]}
/>

Some themes included icons for popular DEs like GNOME, KDE, Deepin, and others. I felt that it would be impossible to cover all cases, and chose a text-based list instead. Icons don't offer enough detail anyway; what if I wanted GNOME on both Xorg and Wayland?

The user picture (if you choose to enable it) also acts as a user switcher. All it really does is prefill in the user field. The last user logged in is saved, however, and filled in for you next time.

<VideoGif
  vids={[{ src: "/projects/sddm-theme-corners/user-picture-inputs.mp4", type: "video/mp4" }]}
/>

The login button is grayed out until both input fields are filled out.

> Am I assuming that every user should have a non-empty password? Yes, yes I am.

Tying everything together are subtle animations that occur when popups come in and out of view. I especially like what happens when you enter a incorrect login:

  vids={[{ src: "/projects/sddm-theme-corners/incorrect-login-anim.mp4", type: "video/mp4" }]}
/>

Don't like the colors? I've exposed numerous config options that allow you to theme pretty much everything. You can also change the font and corner radius of the UI; however, the layout itself cannot be modified. After all, stuff in `corners` should stay in the corners!

## Learning Qt Quick and QML

Building the login theme was the most difficult part of the process. I had no prior experience with QML; this was my first time learning about the existence of Qt! As of December 2023, SDDM's own [documentation](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/blob/develop/docs/THEMING.md) is also rather lacking and hasn't been updated in _years_.

This is where previous SDDM themes really helped me get my footing. By looking through their code, I learned that `Main.qml` is the main entry file for SDDM. I discovered the existence of `theme.conf` and how to support customization options in my own code. I saw real, working examples of QML syntax, including utilizing a QML object's `id` attribute and adding custom properties.

I definitely committed some coding sins figuring out how to hook everything together. I'm particularly proud of this abomination:

```
Component.onCompleted: {
  if (userPicture.enabled) {
    userPicture.source = userWrapper.items.get(userList.currentIndex).model.icon;
  }
}
```

I revisited this line for the write-up, and... I have no idea what it does. I wish I left, like, a single comment. I think it updates the picture displayed when you switch users.

## Try it out!

I've been using it everyday with no complaints. I might be biased, though.

While SDDM is best known for being KDE's display manager, it actually works for any desktop environment. So `corners` does as well! If you're on Linux and like what you see, do test it out and lemme know what you think. I've provided [installation instructions](https://github.com/aczw/sddm-theme-corners#installation) for the AUR as well as manual installation.

Happy ricing! üçö

## Bundows

[Windows support for Bun](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.1) got released recently. I immediately tried it out because I've heard about how fast it is, and the reception on the macOS side has been great so far.

The experience... is the same! I guess that was what they were going for; it _should_ feel seamless. And although my monkey brain can't get excited unless there's something life changing, I can acknowledge the work and effort the Bun team put in to maintain parity.

> **From the future:** I didn't bother running benchmarks when I first switched, so just now I did a really quick informal test using pnpm 9.5.0 and bun 1.1.18.
>
> I installed all dependencies for a clean clone of this website's repo, and... pnpm was almost 20 seconds _faster!_ 39 seconds versus 58. Windows 11. (I cleaned pnpm's store.)
>
> I might be doing something wrong because in Bun's release post, it claims that it ran 18x faster than pnpm. But even if Bun is slower, I suppose the advantage of using it is the myriad of other features it brings along.

### Subshells

Everything works for the most part, but I did run into an issue about subshells not being implemented. The turnaround for this issue was _very_ quick though; it was [filed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/9781) on the release date, and _two days later_ they marked it as fixed.

> Just from eyeballing the [PR](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/9905/files), the implementation doesn't seem very trivial either. So the Bun team is just cracked. Gotcha. üò≠

## Removing the blurb drawer :(

It is with a heavy heart that I announce the removal of the blurb drawer experiment. It was a fan favorite during the one release it existed in ~~what the hell am I saying~~.

Since the initial release, I fixed numerous issues around the drawer, including breakages on mobile, small gaps between the bar and image, as well as simplifying the CSS and HTML attributes needed to make it work.

<figure>
  <Border>
    <VideoGif content={{ collection: "changelog", folder: "v3.2.0" }} name="blurb-resizing" />
  </Border>
  <figcaption>
    **The bottom bars "jump" while resizing.** I'll try my best to find a JS-less solution, which
    was the root cause of my problems.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Issues remained though: the sudden jumping of the bar to its absolutely position on page load, jittering on window resize, etc. So for now, it's gone.

### Disabling hover styles when unsupported

The drawer only animated upon cursor hover. On devices with no concept of "hovering" this led to weird issues of the hover effect becoming ["sticky."](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+hover+sticky+mobile)

> I didn't realize the problem I was facing had a name and was so prevalent! I thought _I_ was just fucking something up.

While trying to fix this issue, I learned that CSS supports checking whether the current device supports hovering, as well as the type of screen interaction (touch, mouse, etc.). This is similar to applying styles only at certain screen widths; in fact, it also uses [`@media` at-rules.](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mf-interaction)

I also learned that Tailwind supports guarding all hover effects [behind this feature](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/8394). They've hidden it behind a config flag because technically it's a breaking change, but it will be on by default in v4. I've gone ahead and turned it on now; even though the blurb drawer is no more, it's still relevant to other stuff (e.g. links).

```ts
// In tailwind.config.ts, Tailwind v3.x.x only
const config = {
  /* ...other stuff... */
  future: {
    hoverOnlyWhenSupported: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

## Experiment: view transitions + posts page

[View transitions](https://astro.build/blog/astro-290/) were introduced in Astro 2.9, but I've never taken advantage of them because they were a bit tricky to work with. I decided to revisit them in this release because of multiple things coming together:

1. I [wrote a post](/posts/link-shortener) about a small project I made with the new Astro DB service.
2. Now that I have more than four posts, I reintroduced the all posts page, because it's now necessary (I'll only show four posts on the homepage).
3. I noticed multiple pages on my site shared the same things: post titles, blurbs, cover images, and tags. This was the perfect candidate for view transitions.
4. It's been several months since Astro 2.9 was released, and many things have been fixed/improved.

So after a bit of tinkering I ended up with this:

<Border>
  <VideoGif content={{ collection: "changelog", folder: "v3.2.0" }} name="view-transitions" />
</Border>

I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty slick. One issue I'm facing is that the transitions are sorta slow? There is a noticeable delay between clicking a link and the transition occurring. Sometimes, it can take several _seconds_. This didn't happen before enabling it.

> It might have to do with the fact that using view transitions switches your site over to using client-side navigation, i.e. link routing via JavaScript.

So I'm still on the fence about keeping it. It's a purely visual change so I can easily revert it if need be.

## Rendering 404 on the same URL

Last release I fixed issues around SSR and custom 404 error pages. One downside is that it redirects users to `/404`, meaning the original invalid URL wasn't maintained in the address bar.

It turns out that the solution was really simple. I simply check if the slug in the response URL matches one of the slug IDs of a known post, and set the response headers and page content accordingly. Do this in a catch-all `[...slug].astro` file:

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

let posts = await getCollection("posts");
let currPost = posts.find((post) => post.slug === Astro.params.slug);

// If the current slug doesn't exist (aka the post doesn't exist), then we
// return a 404 for this request, and render the 404 page instead of the post
const notFound = !currPost;
---

{notFound ? <NotFoundPage /> : <PostLayout post={currPost} />};
```

### Drafts

Turns out I never actually checked if a post is published or not, so people were still able to access drafts if they had the right slug ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is easily fixed by also checking if the current post is published or not and adding that to the overall `notFound` result:

```ts
// We want to show unpublished posts during dev mode
const notFound = !currPost || (!import.meta.env.DEV && !currPost.data.published);
```

## Bundows

[Windows support for Bun](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.1) got released recently, and I immediately tried it out because I've heard about how fast it is, and the reception on the macOS side has been great so far.

> **From the future:** I didn't bother running benchmarks when I first switched so just now I did a really quick informal test using pnpm 9.5.0 and bun 1.1.18.

It works for the most part, but I did run into an issue about subshells not being implemented. The turnaround for this issue was _very_ quick though; it was [filed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/9781) on the release date, and _two days later_ they marked it as fixed.

Just from eyeballing the [PR](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/9905/files), the implementation doesn't seem very trivial either. So these Bun guys are simply just cracked.

## aczw.dev

> **From the future:** this is the last prerelease before v1! It's still live at [old.charleszw.com](https://old.charleszw.com). Why? I dunno. Nostalgia. :FeelsGoodMan:

I've picked a domain name for my site: `aczw.dev`. Explanation: I use the handle "aczw" everywhere online and it's basically a combination of my name and some other stuff. Also I'm a dev or something so. Yeah. Anyway take a look at what I have so far.

![What my homepage currently looks like.](./aczw-homepage.png)

The layout of the site is split into two: the fixed sidebar on the left, and the actual content on the right. The idea is that the sidebar will hold important things that should be on the screen at all times, and then the content on the right is scrollable.

## Learning CSS

<VideoGif content={{ collection: "changelog", folder: "v0.4.0" }} name="img-hover" />

CSS is _amazing_. I can't believe I can animate almost anything, and how simple it is. I'm using it here on the border radius of these cards. This allows me to do this cool animation on hover, and make the transition look seamless. Everything just works.

The card is currently a placeholder for images. Eventually I want to be able to click on the image, and make it expand to fill the whole screen. I'm sure I can do that with CSS as well.

## Todo

I still need to fill in the design section with actual content.

As a sort of easter egg, I'm going to let you switch theme colors on the site by clicking the logo. I already have the color palette ready...

    **"Dash" color palette.** As the name implies, it is partially inspired by Geometry Dash.

Finally, I want to do more with music (e.g. showing off my playlists or what I've listened to recently. I know that Last.fm has an API that I can use).

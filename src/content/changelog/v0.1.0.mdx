## Hello world!

Aaaaaand we are live. Right now the repo just contains the base code from running `create-t3-app`. I mostly wanted to test out Cloudflare Pages and see if everything was set up correctly. And it is! So welcome. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

Technically, the first commit was made [a while ago](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website/commit/5e634c23261a5a81454120f320b33fdef8e6adcb), but I didn't do anything with it. Since then, T3 has released multiple new versions, so I decided to delete everything and start anew.

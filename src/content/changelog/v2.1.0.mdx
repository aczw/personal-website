In this release, I fleshed out the project write-ups, so most of the changes will be related to them. I finished two write-ups, and began work on several more! Some smaller changes:

- Display project metadata in a table-like grid at the top of each write-up
- Added last updated date to the footer
- Experiment with using Bun

The write-ups I finished are about this website and my small Unity game, [RCW](/posts/rcw). Make sure to check them out! I also began work on a post for Mini Minecraft.

> **From the future:** unfortunately, this website's write-up doesn't exist anymore. It's largely been replaced by these changelog you're currently reading :)

## GIF-less GIFs

Sometimes, when you're trying to a make a point, a visualization is helpful. Sometimes, even an image is not enough; you want something _moving_. But, while working on this update I learned that [GIFs are actually worse than MP4s](https://web.dev/patterns/web-vitals-patterns/video/video-gif) in terms of space efficiency.

Thing is, GIFs were primarily designed for images, and not videos. Animated GIFs were expected to only have a few frames at most, simply animations. This is why they essentially stored each frame as an _entirely new image_, unlike dedicated video formats, which more generally only store the _changes_ between frames.

Following the web.dev link above, I created a custom `<Gif />` component that simply plays videos in the style of GIFs:

```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="rounded-md bg-sweater-9">
  <slot />
</video>
```

Then in my MDX file, I can import a MP4 video, and add it as a video source.

```mdx
import Gif from "@/components/gif.astro";
import amazingVideo from "./amazing-video.mp4";

## Amazing heading

Some writing blah blah blah. Here, to illustrate:

<Gif>
  <source src={buttonsFigma} type="video/mp4"></source>
</Gif>

Incredible, right?
```

Using MP4 files actually makes my job a lot easier, because Windows' Snipping Tool outputs MP4 by default, which is what I've been using to screen record.

## Customizing MDX components

I was happy to learn that MDX allows you to [customize](https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components/) the HTML components that you want rendered for each Markdown element.

This includes inline code, codeblocks, images, lists, callouts, and even strikethrough text (renders to a [`<del>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del), only available in GitHub Flavored Markdown, which Astro supports by default. TIL about `<del>`, and correspondingly, `<ins>`).

So before I even finished a write-up, I took some time to customize stuff to my liking. Now everything is themed correctly.

### Auto linking headings

When Astro parses each Markdown file and renders it to HTML, it transpiles each Markdown heading into the corresponding `<hX>` element, and adds an `id` attribute to it.

Well, in my custom `<h2>` component that I pass to MDX, I can destructure the `id` attribute from `Astro.props` and use it. Here, I make every heading contain an anchor element with the `href` set to `id` so that people can get a copy of the current URL at this header.

> I did this before discovering that there are less hacky ways of achieving the same results, i.e. using a [rehype plugin](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) that does this for you. But hey, if it works it works.

I also display a little hash symbol off to the side when you hover over the heading, so that the user knows it's linkable. For example, this is my `h2.astro` file:

```astro
---
import { type HTMLAttributes } from "astro/types";
import { Hash } from "lucide-astro";

type Props = HTMLAttributes<"h2">;

const { id, ...attrs } = Astro.props;
---

<h2 id={id} {...attrs} class="text-lg text-sweater-2">
  <a href={`#${id}`} class="group relative -ml-2 flex w-fit items-center gap-1.5 pl-2">
    <slot />
    <Hash
      size={16}
      class="stroke-transparent transition-colors group-hover:stroke-sweater-5 content:absolute content:-left-4"
      aria-hidden="true"
    />
  </a>
</h2>
```

Don't forget that when we destructure `Astro.props`, we have to manually attach any remaining attributes onto the `<h2>` element via the spread operator. That's what the `{...attrs}` does.

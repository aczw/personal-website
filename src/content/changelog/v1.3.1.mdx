Small update not worthy of a minor version bump. Patch it is.

- Make all alt text for images italic. Only shown when the image fails to load.
- I removed the weird hover action on the portfolio page. It was just too gimmicky, and didn't even show up on mobile.
- General reordering of projects and portfolio pieces.
- Add a distinction between _prominent_ and _lowkey_ projects, and display them differently. Prominent projects are higher effort and get more details.
- Update my bio and wording on a lot of pages.

## Randomized scrolling text

Instead of the hardcoded "soitgoes" phrase, I now select from a list of phrases, pick one, and render it. This is done in the Astro frontmatter, so it's decided on the server. I then use the same script as before on the client side to actually animate it.

The phrases:

- `soitgoes`
- `aczw`
- `newfaces`
- `doitagain`
- `tilinfinity`
- `suboptimal`
- `theendisnever`
- `promiseme`
- `allitcosts`

I wonder if you can guess where they all come from...

Also, I just want to point out that this is not that easy to do with React, which expects components to render the same thing on every rerender (given the same inputs). I'm not even sure if this would pass React's strict mode.

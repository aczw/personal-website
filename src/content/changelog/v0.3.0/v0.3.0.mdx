Spent a few days prototyping a color scheme for the website as well as some potential designs for the layout. I'm going to try building it now.

Some designers use a logo to represent themselves. I liked that idea, so I recreated and digitized something that I've been drawing for a few years now.

> **From the future:** the site looks nothing like the picture anymore, but I think I got a lot of the fundamentals right. The logo and font choice have all survived to present day.

    picture.

To somewhat give an explanation, it's supposed to symbolize an eye. Whenever I draw people, I draw two of these on their faces, similar to what [KAWS](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kaws&iax=images&ia=images) does. It's simple and easy to remember; but, the best part is that the symbol is part of Unicode: â¦», or `U+29BB`.

I've decided to keep using Tailwind, and so the color palette has been added to my config. As for the logo, I've exported it as a SVG from Figma.

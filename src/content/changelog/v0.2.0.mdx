## Learning React

Finished the [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) from React's website. I'm new to React and web dev in general so this seemed like a good place to start. I'm also trying out something called Tailwind for CSS, because it seems easier than writing real CSS.

I'm currently using Cloudflare Pages to host my website. So I'm trying to make sense of all of that as well. What the hell is domain.

## Tic-tac-toe

It's birthday week for America, and I've been learning React through their [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). I'm new to web dev so this seemed like a good place to start. I'm also trying out something called Tailwind CSS, because it seems easier than writing actual CSS.

I've spent the past few days polishing the game, which I've shortened to just "ttt" because typing the full name out is really tiresome (only half joking).

Across 35+ commits (that I should have merged together in a PR or something) I've changed just about everything. Here is a laundry list of changes:

- Added TypeScript, because I really missed types
- Redesigned the look and layout of the game. I really put Tailwind to the test, and I like it. I've also tried making the page more mobile friendly.
- The game state is now tracked via a simple state machine.
- Renamed the route to `/ttt`
- Generally reduced complexity and redundant code.

Definitely a bit overkill, but I'm glad I spent so much time trying out things because it really helped me understand what React wanted me to do, and why. Plus, hacking on the base code was really fun.

> **From the future:** `/ttt` is gone now, but if you would like to see what it looked like, it's currently live at [ttt.charleszw.com](https://ttt.charleszw.com). So grab a friend and play a game or two! Or, you could play against yourself. I respect that too.

## Text animation

~~Literally copied from~~ Inspired by [rauno.me's project page](https://rauno.me/projects), I wanted to see if I could achieve a similar effect. It's probably not very efficient (I'm doing a _lot_ of JS string concatenation), but the final effect looks pretty good.

<Border>
  <VideoGif content={{ collection: "changelog", folder: "v3.3.0" }} name="text-ani" />
</Border>

This took me so long to figure out. Lots of off-by-one index errors. I can usually figure things out in my head but this was a pen and paper moment.

## Redesigned all posts page

For a page that's supposed to list every post I've ever made, it's not very space efficient. I removed the images for each entry and generally condensed things.

### In the spotlight

You'll see this on the homepage as well, but if you're on desktop try hovering over a post. You'll see that every element _not_ being hovered will dim.

<Border>
  <VideoGif content={{ collection: "changelog", folder: "v3.3.0" }} name="hover-ani" />
</Border>

After seeing it in action on [paco.me's writing page](https://paco.me/writing), I wanted to ~~copyright infringe it~~ try recreating it, and I think I was successful.

> Their implementation also has a nice fade-out animation that I'm too lazy to figure out.

The search for an implementation led me down a rabbit hole: this [CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/hover-on-everything-but/) led me to this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12574836), which led me to `:has()`, which ended up not being necessary. I was able to condense [this final solution](https://css-tricks.com/a-pure-css-gallery-focus-effect-with-not/) into a single Tailwind directive that should be applied on the parent element of a list of children:

```
[&>CHILD_ELEMENT:not(:hover)]:hover:brightness-[65%]
```

where `CHILD_ELEMENT` should be replaced with the corresponding HTML element.

It's beautifully ugly. It causes all child elements within a parent who _aren't_ being hovered over to be dimmed. I'm using brightness instead of opacity because I'm already animating opacity with `animate-fade`, so it will conflict. Filters achieve the same appearance though.

Note that if there are gaps between children, you have to add `pointer-events-none` to the parent holding the children, and `pointer-events-auto` to each child:

```html
<ul class="pointer-events-none [&>li:not(:hover)]:hover:brightness-[65%]" />
  <li class="pointer-events-auto transition-[filter]">Item 1</li>
  <li class="pointer-events-auto transition-[filter]">Item 2</li>
  <li class="pointer-events-auto transition-[filter]">Item 3</li>
  <!-- ...more children... -->
</ul>
```

## Dynamic Open Graph (OG) image generation

OG images are helpful for SEO, page metadata, and attracting viewers. They're the little thumbnails that social medias usually display under links.

The standard way of adding an OG image to a page is to first create the image, then host it somewhere, and then link to it in the `<head>` element of that page.

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="OG_IMAGE_URL_HERE" />
```

The other way is to _dynamically generate_ an image depending on the page request. This is especially useful if your website has thousands of pages, and manually making an image for each one becomes impossible. Now, that is _not_ the case for this site, but I wanted to learn how to do it anyway.

### @vercel/og

Vercel actually offers a [`@vercel/og`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation/og-image-api#@vercel/og-reference) package that does this for you, but I quickly found out that Astro API routes don't support JSX syntax, so you have to fake React element objects using [this abhorrent syntax](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement#what-is-a-react-element-exactly). I mean, this is literally why JSX was created in the first place; to _not_ use it. So I'm not doing that.

Looking more closely at the package, I realized could basically recreate it with the following packages:

- [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), which takes HTML/CSS and renders it to a SVG
- [satori-html](https://github.com/natemoo-re/satori-html), which takes HTML strings and transforms it into the necessary React element objects for us, to be consumed by Satori
- [resvg-js](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js), which renders the SVG to an image

### Implementation

Create a `/api/og.png.ts` API route in your Astro project. This route will generate a PNG file named "og.png" depending on the URL parameters passed into it.

I currently generate two kinds of images: generic images for routes, and specific ones for posts. To check which one it is, I try to read the corresponding URL parameter from the incoming request to see if it exists. For even more Astro awesomeness, if the request is indeed for a post, I can fetch the metadata for it by calling `getEntry()`.

I then write the HTML I want inside a string, and let satori-html transform it into the correct shape for me, which I then pass into Satori. Finally, I feed the generated SVG to resvg-js, whose image data I then buffer into a `Response` object, along with cache control.

My final file looks similar to this:

```ts
import { getEntry } from "astro:content";

import { Resvg } from "@resvg/resvg-js";
import satori from "satori";
import { html } from "satori-html";

const GET = async ({ request }) => {
  const requestUrl = new URL(request.url);
  const params = requestUrl.searchParams;

  const maybeRoute = params.get("route");
  const maybePost = params.get("post");

  let content = { kind: "route", route: "" };
  if (maybeRoute) {
    content.route = maybeRoute;
  } else if (maybePost) {
    const post = await getEntry("posts", maybePost);
    if (post) {
      let {
        data: { title, posted },
      } = post;
      content = { kind: "post", title, date: posted };
    }
  }

  // Since `html()` accepts strings, I can use a templated string to insert
  // whatever I want into the final HTML string, e.g. metadata from the
  // `content` object I created above.
  const markup = html(`<div>HTML here...</div>`);

  const svg = await satori(markup, {
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
    fonts: [
      /* get fonts from filesystem */
    ],
  });

  const resvg = new Resvg(svg, {
    fitTo: {
      mode: "width",
      value: 1280,
    },
  });

  const image = resvg.render();

  return new Response(image.asPng(), {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "image/png",
      "Cache-Control": "public, no-transform, max-age=604800" /* one week */,
    },
  });
};

export { GET };
```

Then to actually use this in my pages, I link to the API route and include the specific URL parameter I want. For example, this generates an OG image for my Mini Minecraft post:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://charleszw.com/api/og.png?post=mini-minecraft" />
```

I've also set it up so I can enter custom content.

```html
<meta
  property="og:image"
  content="https://charleszw.com/api/og.png?heading=my%20pee%20pee%20hurts"
/>
```

## Other changes

- Make images optional for posts. Sometimes there is no need for a cover, ya know? This allowed me to condense `/posts` as well.
- Added dates to all posts. I went into my commit history and found the exact dates that posts were made public. This is more useful than tags.
- Disabled view transitions. The delay while routing became too obnoxious.

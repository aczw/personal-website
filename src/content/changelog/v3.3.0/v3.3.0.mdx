## Text animation

~~Literally copied from~~ Inspired by [rauno.me's project page](https://rauno.me/projects), I wanted to see if I could achieve a similar effect. It's probably not very efficient (I'm doing a _lot_ of JS string concatenation), but the final effect looks pretty good. I also made it a web component, for some reason.

> This took me so long to figure out. Lots of off-by-one index errors. Had to pull out the pen and paper and write things down.

How it works is that

## Redesigned all posts page

For a page that's supposed to list every post I've every made, it's not very space efficient. I removed the images for each entry and generally condensed things.

### Chosen one

You'll see this on the homepage as well, but if you're on desktop try hovering over a post. You'll see a cool effect: every element _not_ being hovered will dim.

After seeing it in action on [paco.me's writing page](https://paco.me/writing), I wanted to ~~copyright infringe it~~ try recreating it.

> Their implementation also has a nice fade-out animation that I'm too lazy to figure out.

Well, this [CSS-Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/hover-on-everything-but/) led me to this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12574836), which led me to `:has()`, which ended up not being necessary, and after trying to figure out how to enter arbitrary values in Tailwind, I was able to condense [this final solution](https://css-tricks.com/a-pure-css-gallery-focus-effect-with-not/) into a single Tailwind directive:

```
[&>HTMLCHILDELT:not(:hover)]:hover:brightness-[65%]
```

It's beautifully ugly. I'm using brightness instead of opacity because I'm already animating opacity with `animate-fade`, so it will conflict. Filters achieve the same appearance though.

Note that if there are gaps between children, then add `pointer-events-none` to the parent holding the children, and `pointer-events-auto` to each child:

```html
<ul class="pointer [&>li:not(:hover)]:hover:brightness-[65%]" />
  <li class="pointer-events-auto transition-[filter]">Item 1</li>
  <li class="pointer-events-auto transition-[filter]">Item 2</li>
  <li class="pointer-events-auto transition-[filter]">Item 3</li>
  <!-- ... -->
</ul>
```

## Other changes for v3.3.0

- Make images optional for posts. Sometimes there is no "cover image" for a post, ya know? Not everything has to be big and grand. Honestly, Link Shortener didn't need a cover, but I had to make one because it was required. This gave me more reason to condense `/posts` as well.
- Removed post tags. They were not useful. I don't have enough posts to worry about filtering.
- Added dates to post. I went into my commit history and found the exact dates that posts were made public. Now this is more useful.

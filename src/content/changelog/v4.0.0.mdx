This was originally going to be v4.5.0. Then, it changed to v5.0.0. Now it's v4.0.0, smaller than the original version number. Lemme explain.

Because this isn't exactly rocket code I can do whatever the hell I want.

## Website changelog and "two" new posts

There's now a dedicated page listing all the changes I've made to it, ever. You're currently looking at it. This page can always be accessed again from the version number in the footer.

I also wrote a little post about it, which you can [read here](/posts/changelogs). It goes into the inspiration for the idea and how I set it up. Once again, Astro made everything really easy to do.

### That website post is pointless now I guess

I've never known what to do with [the post about this website](/posts/wip). If you've noticed, the content is different now; the old post used to be about the many changes this site has undergone. I had to update it every time I changed something. I sure wish there was an easier, better system to do that... oh wait.

Anyway, after some <span aria-hidden="true" aria-label="deep thinking">𝓭𝓮𝓮𝓹 𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓷𝓴𝓲𝓷𝓰</span> I've replaced it with something new. Honestly wasn't sure how to end the post, as I usually write about projects, which I can summarize neatly with a conclusion. This was a different subject.

I told myself that this will be the last time I'll ever touch it, but... it's me I'm talking about.

## MEWO cursor

If you're on desktop, try hovering over the quote on the homepage. You should see MEWO replace your cursor as long as it remains on the quote.

Honestly, after adding the previous text animation, I wasn't too sure what else to do with it. I figured that since I removed the quote author, I might as well add it back some other way.

Unfortunately MEWO has black fur, so it's a bit hard to see. More reason to add a sitewide light mode.

I might also add sound effects in the future, for when you click on it. Not sure though.

## Other changes in v4.0.0

- adjust spacing for everything
- create more specific layouts on top of a base layout (e.g. include header and footer already)
- Revert `<MewoQuote />` back from being a web component
- Rewrite bio on homepage. Add more about my school clubs :\)
- Add more stuff to OG metadata, tell browser my site prefers dark
- Add `subtitle` as a Tailwind utility. Sometimes standard text feels a bit too bright for what I'm trying to convey, so I set its opacity to 90% and slightly color it.
- Delete `<NotFound />` because I realized you could directly import entire Astro pages as a component! So I can just import and use my site-wide 404 page in everything else.
- Display date on OG metadata for each post (instead of tags, which have been destroyed)

Really utilize Tailwind `@layer` directives more. I've moved a lot of unruly in-component directives to `base.css`. For example, I inlined the CSS for the MEWO cursor, which now has an absolute path, meaning in theory I could style anything with it.

Instead of being inlined like this on the HTML element

```html
<p class="cursor-[url('../assets/mewo.webp')_32_32,_not-allowed]">Incredible quote.</p>
```

It's now easier to read like this:

```css
@layer utilities {
  .mewo-quote {
    cursor:
      url("/src/assets/mewo.webp") 32 32,
      not-allowed;
  }
}
```

Another use case was with Berkeley Mono: its weight range spans from 100 to 150. Since regular weight is usually 400, I always had to specify `font-[100]` right after using `font-mono`. I also prefer my monospaced fonts slightly smaller than normal, so it was usually also followed by a `font-[14.5px]`. Now all of that's gone.

### More stuff:

- New `<Main />` props to centralize common cases (min height, type of max width)
- Clamp the song name in the footer to one line. Looks kind of weird now, so we'll see.
- Combined badge-shaped elements (for now just the resume and version buttons) into a single `<Pill />` component. It's called a pill because it sounds cooler than a badge.
- All text-based links in the header and footer use the `<Pill />` component now.
- Created a `<CustomContent />` component that abstracts away configuring MDX components. Used by posts and this page.
- Adjusted spacing between paragraphs in rendered MDX
- Add a little separator between content for posts with no cover images
- Wrapped `<VideoGif />` in extra y-margin
- Update packages

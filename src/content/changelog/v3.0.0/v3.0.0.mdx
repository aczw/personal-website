What? So soon? Another major version bump? But we only had one minor release for v2!

Well, not really. Between v2.1.0 and this release, more than two months have passed. Happy belated new year, by the way. Hope things are off to a good start.

I've started treating these major releases as a sort of _spring cleaning._ The more time passes after the previous major update, the more random crap I tend to add. You see, I often use this site as a playground, testing stuff out and seeing what I can and can't build. And I really do love having a space to mess around and do whatever.

But, _stuff_ piles up. Gets out of hand. And it annoys me. So I'm here today to clean it up.

## charleszw.com

I changed the site URL again. It's now charleszw.com. What can I say? I feel that this was inevitable. It looks official, it's my actual name, and it gets the job done. Now, I've also bought another domain: czw.sh. This is sorta the _opposite._ I'll probably attach subdomains to it in the future for projects I want to showcase.

Anyways. If nothing else, a domain change itself probably demands a major version bump.

## Failed experiment: image carousels

Sometimes I wanted to showcase many images in a row. For example, a slideshow of images for a particular project. Displaying them vertically one by one takes up too much space. So I decided to try building an image carousel that scrolled horizontally.

<figure>
  <div style="border-width:5px;border-radius:0.5rem;border-color:#1D193D">
    <VideoGif content={{ collection: "changelog", folder: "v3.0.0" }} name="image-carousel" />
  </div>
  <figcaption>**Image carousel.** It worked until it didn't.</figcaption>
</figure>

Building it wasn't too difficult. Some JavaScript, button event listeners, and programmatic scrolling based on the width of the current image.

And they served a legitimately useful purpose: inside write-ups, they allowed me to show many pictures successively. For projects that didn't have write-ups yet, I was able to provide some screenshots for the viewer to scroll through.

But I realized that I just did not _like_ it. Firstly, it didn't even work that well. The arrows would either over or under scroll, and the current image counter often broke. So much so that I [entirely removed it](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website/commit/8b3434539a74a94cad490f4b730e62d79fb0c8f5). A surefire sign that _all_ of it was going to be removed soon.

It just didn't live up to my standards of something that was used so much across the site.

So yeah. I still gotta figure out how to display many images at once. But I would rather have nothing for now than this.

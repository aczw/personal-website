What? So soon? Another major version bump? But we only had one minor release for v2! Well, not really. Between v2.1.0 and this release, more than two months have passed.

I've started treating these major releases as a sort of _spring cleaning_; the more time passes after the previous major update, the more random crap I tend to add. You see, I often use this site as a playground, testing stuff out and seeing what I can and can't build. And I love having a space to mess around and do whatever.

But, _stuff_ piles up. Gets out of hand. And it annoys me. So I'm here today to clean it up.

## charleszw.com

I changed the site URL again. It's now charleszw.com. What can I say? I feel that this was inevitable. It looks official, it's my actual name, and it gets the job done. Now, I've also bought another domain: czw.sh. This is sorta the _opposite._ I'll probably attach subdomains to it in the future for projects I want to showcase.

Anyways. If nothing else, a domain change itself probably demands a major version bump.

## Failed experiment: image carousels

I want to mention this because it's one of the experiments that I did that made me want to restart. So, sometimes I wanted to showcase many images in a row, right? For example, a slideshow of images for a particular project. Displaying them verticaly one by one takes up too much space. So I decided to try building an image carousel that scrolled horizontally.

Some time passed after building it, and I realized I _did not_ like it. Firstly, it didn't even work that well. The arrows would either over or under scroll, and the current image counter often broke. So much so that I [entirely removed it](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website/commit/8b3434539a74a94cad490f4b730e62d79fb0c8f5). A surefire sign that _all_ of it was going to be removed soon.

So yeah. I still gotta figure out how to display many images at once. But I would rather have nothing than this.

## charl.sh

Welcome to the v1 release! This will be a long one. I've changed a lot of things since last time, from the framework I'm using to the domain itself. Let me explain.

### Overcomplicated tech stack

Now that I have used [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg) for a bit, I can confidently say that I regret bootstrapping my website with it.

- I wasn't trying to build an _app_. I was trying to build a _personal website_. (Sometimes they're the same, but not for me.) T3 is a great and powerful solution for the first goal, but pretty overkill for the second.
- I completely ignored most of the integrations, such as tRPC, Prisma, and NextAuth.js.
- On a certain level, Next.js too felt overkill. This is definitely more subjective, but I wanted something simpler and lighter.

But, there were many features I enjoyed using, including React's JSX syntax, T3's Tailwind integration, and Next.js' file-based routing. Whatever I used next would get extra brownie points if these were available as well.

### Nonflexible layout

While my website layout is definitely unique, that doesn't mean that it was good. As time passed, I felt that it was too busy, distracting, and limiting to work with.

- The sidebar had too much unnecessary info. For example, my bio doesn't need to be visible at all times, because at most you read it once. Also, it didn't need to take up ~1/4 of my screen space all the time.
- I really wanted to share my music interests! But I couldn't find a suitable place to yap about it. In the end I put it in the sidebar, but it never felt right...
- Containing every project or portfolio inside its own card doesn't work. Originally, I wanted to keep my site a one-pager, but it turns out I like talking a lot about my own passion projects. Cramming everything into the right resulted in a lot of scrolling.

### Stylistic choices

As I worked with the color palette, I realized it was very restricting. I only chose 6 varying shades, with too much difference between any two adjacent colors. This made it hard to style elements; it was either too light or too dark. I found myself often adjusting the opacity of elements as a cheap way to give myself additional colors.

My choice of font size was also way too big. Waaaaaay too big. I guess I made my Figma prototype relatively large and I translated it over 1:1.

Finally, I didn't like the hue of purple I picked. It was more pink than purple :\(

## Changes from prerelease

Once again, I [completely deleted everything](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website/commit/1eaafc382b2bcd085272c8bd36f815cce41b1a7c) and began anew. So, what did I change? Here are the highlights.

### Switching frameworks

It was around this time that I discovered [Astro](https://astro.build/), which advertised itself as a framework for content-first websites. That immediately caught my eye, and pretty soon I made the switch.

> At this point I did not have a blog, so "content-driven" really interested me.

Here are some reasons:

- React-like reusable components using JSX syntax
- First-class support for transpiling Markdown/MDX files to HTML
- Support for multiple UI frameworks. This meant I could gradually learn Astro syntax and transfer everything over from React. It also enables cool features like [component islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).

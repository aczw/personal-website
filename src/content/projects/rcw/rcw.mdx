Random Color Words (RCW) is a simple endless minigame about selecting the correct pair of colors and words. They're also randomly generated. Crazy name, I know.

This was my first time using Unity and my first full game. Going into this project, I wasn't looking to create anything new or life-changing. My main goal was to familiarize myself with all aspects of the development process, and have the end result be something completely playable, polished, and cohesive.

## Gameplay

The gameplay loop is simple. The core idea is taken from <Link href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/643270/OLDTV/" newTab>OLDTV</Link> (which you should go play right now, it's free). Both of our games are heavily inspired by the <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect" newTab>Stroop test</Link>, a psychological phenomenon where reaction time becomes delayed when the stimuli is incongruent.

In normal human words, stuff that catches you off guard slows you down. Take these two words, for example.

    <Img src={ import("./purple-comparison.png") } alt="There are two words and both spell out 'purple.' The one on the left is colored purple, and the one on the right is colored red." />

One word is colored purple, and the other red. It turns out that it's easier for us to name the color of the left word than the right word, because the *word* matches the *color*. Whe the word reads "purple" but is actually colored red, this throws us off and delays delays our answer.

How interesting. Why don't we add a timer, and force the player to decide whether the word matches its color in time. If you don't react fast enough, you lose. And the faster you react, the more points you get.

I keep it simple by only using five colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple.

## Art direction

RCW is an endless, fast-paced minigame about getting the highest score. I was therefore inspired by arcade games and stuff like that. In particular, I became obsessed with the art of <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Heaven_Fever" newTab>Rhythm Heaven Fever</Link>, a Wii game from 2012. I wanted to channel its chaotic vibe, juicy-looking buttons, and generous use of thick, black borders. The buttons had to look *delicious*.

I also liked the button hover effect in <Link href="https://battlecats.club/en/series/battlecats/" newTab>The Battle Cats</Link>, which flashed bright yellow and magenta. Here, I tried to recreate it in Figma.

I use both the button design and hover effect in RCW. The nice thing about this art style was that it could be consistently applied everywhere.

- Try to add skeumorphism through use of shadows, etc.
- Wrap it in a thick black border
- Add a drop shadow
- If I want to attract the player's attention, add color. Else, use gray
- Inter Inter Inter

Originally I was going for a factory setting, with words potentially "coming down" an assembly line. Honestly, this was out of my Unity skill scope, so I scratched that idea. But you can still see it in the metallic plates and muted gray backgrounds.

### Figma is awesome

One thing that may surprise you is that all the art assets were made in Figma. This includes the start screen, in-game, and game over screen, as well as all the UI.

    <Img src={ import("./figma-ingame.png") } alt="The in-game screen, pause menu, and game over screen were all made in a single Figma file." />

    <Img src={ import("./separated-ui.png") } alt="Each UI component is split into different parts and don't have color so I can set them in Unity and animate fading between colors." />

It kinda feels weird 

buttons mmmmmfff.,,, buttons

### Animating the UI

Checkboards randomly zoom in/out, and randomly change colors. This was possible by simply randomly changing the UV coordinates

## Programming

Coding the game was, for the most part, pretty straight forward. I had Java experience so C# wasn't too far fetched, and reading the Unity documentation/searching things up along the way filled in the necessary gaps. One of the more confusing parts was figuring out what features were built-in and what I had to write on my own (me discovering <Link href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.Lerp.html" newTab>`Color.Lerp`</Link> exists).

Still, there were two new concepts that really stood out to me: coroutines, and events.

import { Vimeo } from "@astro-community/astro-embed-vimeo";

First, let's take a look at this snazzy showcase reel I made (it's less than 3 minutes).

<Vimeo id="893391293" />

It does a nice job of showcasing all of our engine's features, and tells you who worked on what. Just to reiterate the video, I implemented the following features:

- Chunking
- Efficient chunk rendering and face culling
- Block texturing and animations
- Distance fog
- Day/night cycle and sky system (sun, moon, clouds, stars)
- Flood fill lighting
- GUI, inventory, and text rendering

I'll now talk a bit about each feature, their technical details, any design choices, and some challenges I faced. Let's begin!

> Note that I cannot publicly show any code from this project because it was made for a class. Please contact me if you would like to see the code.

## Chunking

Just like Minecraft (and most voxel-based games), we group the world terrain into 16x16x256 collections of blocks. That's 16 blocks in the x- and z-directions, and 256 blocks in height.

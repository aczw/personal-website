import Img from "@/components/img.astro";

I've always wanted a personal website for many reasons. For one, it felt cool to own a website that *belongs* to you and points back at you. It makes me feel like I own a part of the internet (and according to ICANN, I do)! I also recently began learning web dev, and there was no better way to put my skills to the test than to make my own site.

> My site uses the .sh TLD, which doesn't seem to have a [RDAP server](https://deployment.rdap.org/#:~:text=.sh) configured. You could do a WHOIS lookup from the [official registry website](https://www.nic.sh/whois-search.htm?domain_name=charl.sh), but I'm hiding my information anyway :)

A more pragmatic reason is that I can showcase and talk about the projects (like this one!) and portfolio work I've done. As a college student looking for internships, it's nice to be able to point people to a centralized location containing all the stuff I want to show off.

Obviously it all worked out, because you're here now. Welcome! ♪(´▽｀)

I want to use this write-up to explain a bit of my thought process behind the design, colors, and layout of this site, as well as why I picked the tools that I did to help build it.

## aczw.dev

Fun fact: what you're looking at is the second version of my site.

## v2

doing some _extremely_ insecure things. publicly exposing my Last.fm API key, anyone on the client could have CTRL+F'd the fetch URL and would've immediately gotten it. More of a principle thing than anything else. There is no reason for anyone to target me, but it was the wrong thing to do.

Related to this is SWR and the usage of React in this project. I wished that I could use pure Astro components, but in order to fetch data on the client, React libraries like SWR were still superior in terms of the out of the box defaults and features they provide.

## Now

The website is now 100% written using Astro components. This was possible because I updated the way I fetched data, which is now handled in a much more secure way.

### Constraining the width

noticing how all websites with paragraphs keep the width at a fixed size so your eyes don’t have to scan across a large horizontal distance

## Semantic HTML for project tags

While writing this I realized I could make one semantic change to how I wrote the HTML for project tags. Before, each tag was contained within its own `<div>` like this.

```html
<div>
  <div>Tag1</div>
  <div>Tag2</div>
  <div>Tag3</div>
  <!-- ...and so on -->
</div>
```

This was fine and all and visually looked the way I wanted, but out of curiosity I checked how Firefox rendered this page using its Reader View:

<Img src={import("./project-tags-before.png")} alt="Tags are smooshed together and placed on one line, making them unreadable" class="rounded-md" />

Well, that's not good. Firefox is (rightly) parsing my `<div>` tags and displaying no spaces between them. That kinda sucks, I mean, after all, these tags are just a _list_ of technologies associated with each project, it would be nice if they were comma-separated or bullet pointed...

Wait. Hold on. I can fix this.

```html
<!-- this makes more sense! -->
<ul>
  <li>Tag1</li>
  <li>Tag2</li>
  <li>Tag3</li>
  <!-- ...and so on -->
</ul>
```

Firefox now shows this:

<Img src={import("./project-tags-after.png")} alt="Tags are now listed with bullet points." />

I'm still getting used to the idea that most HTML elements don't inherently _mean_ anything. They are, however, significant to the browser, to screen readers, and to other users. It doesn't help that most browsers add their own custom styling, because now I associate `<li>` tags with visual bullet points. This doesn't have to be the case though. My badges still look like badges, but now they're in a list.

> Side note: this is also why I like Tailwind's [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) base styling. For example, they remove all default margins, and unstyle headings and lists.

## Portfolio

I had a great deal of trouble with this page.

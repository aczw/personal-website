One of the homeworks for our procedural graphics class, CIS 5660, was to create a stylized scene mimicking some concept art that you like. In particular, we focused on using Unity Renderer Features to achieve non-photorealistic rendering.

## Concept art

The natural pick for the concept art I wanted to recreate was from [OMORI](https://www.omori-game.com/). Any opportunity I get to work with this game I take it. Here are two pieces that guided me, both by OMOCAT:

<div class="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">

    ![Mari and Basil wearing animal ears on a picnic blanket. Lots of other characters are in the
    background.](ca-2.png)
    <figcaption>
      **Concept art 2.**

    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

I wanted to recreate the scribbly, colored pencils look, with its wobbly and multicolored outlining, pastel colors, purple sky, and picnic blanket motif.
